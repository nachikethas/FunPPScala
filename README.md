# Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Functional programming is becoming increasingly widespread in industry.
This trend is driven by the adoption of Scala as the main programming
language for many applications. Scala fuses functional and
object-oriented programming in a practical package. It interoperates
seamlessly with both Java and Javascript. Scala is the implementation
language of many important frameworks, including Apache Spark, Kafka,
and Akka. It provides the core infrastructure for sites such as Twitter,
Tumblr and also Coursera.

In this course you will discover the elements of the functional
programming style and learn how to apply them usefully in your daily
programming tasks. You will also develop a solid foundation for
reasoning about functional programs, by touching upon proofs of
invariants and the tracing of execution symbolically.

The course is hands on; most units introduce short programs that serve
as illustrations of important concepts and invite you to play with them,
modifying and improving them. The course is complemented by a series
programming projects as homework assignments.

## Learning Outcomes
* Understand the principles of functional programming,
* Write purely functional programs, using recursion, pattern matching,
  and higher-order functions,
* Combine functional programming with objects and classes,
* Design immutable data structures,
* Reason about properties of functions,
* Understand generic types for functional programs

## Recommended Background
You should have at least one year programming experience. Proficiency
with Java or C# is ideal, but experience with other languages such as
C/C++, Python, Javascript or Ruby is also sufficient. You should have
some familiarity using the command line.
